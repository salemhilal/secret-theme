This is a repo to develop a theme for Secret Magazine. It contains a theme, and a wordpress container to load that theme.

Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed, and start the container by running:
```
docker-compose up -d`
````

A vanilla copy of wordpress should be hosted at `localhost:8000`. 

Youâ€™ll need to upload post content. [WPTest](http://wptest.io/) has a bunch of good test data.
